Hey, this is a basic, very-very basic review portal. It allows following options:

1. create venue profile;
2. add a review of the venue with its name and review text;
3. add comments;
4. view/modify/remove the review;
5. Authenticate for comment posting and review removal.

Nothing complex, very simple
